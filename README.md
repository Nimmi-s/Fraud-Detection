This repository focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for a fraud detection dataset. The goal is to understand fraud patterns, identify class imbalance, and uncover trends across demographics, transaction types, geography, and time before building predictive models.

Key Visualizations & Insights

1.Fraud vs Non-Fraud Transactions-Visualized the count and percentage of fraudulent vs non-fraudulent transactions.Used a pie chart to highlight severe class imbalance, a common challenge in fraud detection problems.

2.Fraud Distribution by Gender-Analyzed fraud occurrences across different genders.Pie chart representation helps identify whether fraud cases are disproportionately associated with a specific gender.

3.Fraud Rate by Card Type-Calculated fraud rate (%) for each card type.Bar plot highlights card types with higher fraud exposure, supporting risk-based decision making.

4️.Fraud Trend Over Time (Year-wise)-Extracted year from transaction date.Plotted yearly fraud rate trends to identify increases, declines, or stability in fraudulent activity over time.

5️.Fraud by City (Top 10 Cities)-Focused on cities with the highest transaction volumes.Count plot compares fraudulent vs non-fraudulent transactions to detect location-based fraud concentration.

6️.Fraud Rate by Transaction Type-Computed fraud rate across different transaction types.Bar chart reveals transaction categories that are more prone to fraud.
